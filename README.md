# Baseball-Stuff

Repo full of all my R work related to baseball.

## BBall BS
My scrapbook where I answer random baseball questions that pop in my head.

## 4 Outcomes
Breaks down Fangraphs csv to look at the proportion of PAs ending in the 4 outcomes ESPN/MLB post polls about: In Play Out, Strikeout, Reach Base, Home Run. Code includes funnctions nums4() which returns the proportion for the input player and sim2() which tells you what player's outcomes are most similar to the input player.

## Prop of Team Runs
Twitter User Jeremy Frank @MLBRandomStats posed a question asking which player has driven in or scored the greatest proportion of his team's runs; this code finds that answer.

## MLB Standardized
Using Lahman, standardizes historical baseball stats by league, year, era, etc.
